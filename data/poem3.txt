Colonizers Of Our Mind

The cold wind stiffens my knees 
and tingles my toes.
Midwestern weather-changes 
and brisk walking down flooded streets
passing strangers who need a hug.
Still think that it’s odd 
to ask for what I need.
Keep telling myself they’re only my “wants” 
until my legs get weak.
I know we are the same as two birds 
drifting on the edge of a hurricane.
Engulfed with silent-heavy thoughts not able 
to lift the head or eyes from the ground.
Another long walk connecting puddles 
and the repetitious pulse of footsteps 
on and off repeat.
I remember that dove 
sitting on a telephone line. 
It sounded sad.
Keep thinking I see sad animals in the city.
I remember how life drags me down 
then lifts me up again.
How drugs leave me down, 
have let me drown, 
turned me into a clown 
on repeat.
Symptoms of addiction.
Now I name the monster 
to lure it into the light. 
Urges that seem unstoppable.
Twisting, 
turning, 
and terrifyingly long sleepless nights.
Childhood dreams seem tangled like knotted yarn.
Like grapevines growing slowly, 
and one day wrapped fully around the life tree 
giving me the illusion of daily darkness.
Now my daily rituals bring un-obscured light, 
in hopes of being free. 
Look up while I walk forward, 
towards healing habits. 
Breath in the taste of rain and soil.
Sometimes on walks my mind races 
and I have to sit near a flowing body of water
letting it drown out the sounds 
of my emotions and my self-talk. 
Forgiving myself and letting everything 
go downstream slow and steady.
My whole adult life spent going in and out 
of relationships searching for fixes.
Freeze-framed in the middle of a good-bye.
Freeze-frame in the brain 
from ice crystals on skin membranes.
Learning how to speak, 
but more importantly to listen.
Sorting these tragedies into a reality 
that was always meant for me.
Learning how to say good-bye to the 
lingering emptiness feeling 
on the other side of my cold pressing lips.
Been looking for a kiss to cancel my thoughts.
Set the medicine on the sink so I’d remember, 
taped the list onto my leg so I wouldn’t forget.
Turn everyday into a new experience.
Turn every second into a minute, 
into slowly learning how to be you, 
in this world. 
Learning how to see through 
the distractions to your true path 
so you can get with it.
Memorized every syllable so that 
it still lingers when I listen for it.
A new breath and a new way to think about air.
The ways we sabotage ourselves 
and the pathways unlit towards healing.
Sometimes realizing our errors 
and openly talking can be a hard pill to swallow.
Leaders make a trail for others to follow.
Trying to find purpose among the arm-scarred, 
who are feeling worthless, in this mess of men.
Paint a turd golden and it still smells shitty.
We aughta work harder at building 
and growing communities in our cities.
The birthing grounds for our 
dreams and opportunities.
Sometimes it feels like we’re crawling so slowly 
toward togetherness, erasing debt, 
and trying to find affordability in rent.
Wonder if I dare address the underlying problem 
even though it is going to take 
many more years of solving. 
We have spent our time, 
making profits for others and twisted 
by the media to fight our own brothers.
Our own brothers making this mass media, 
holding our attention, 
draining us like a sink.
He says, “pull on this” 
and holds out a small bag 
with a dangling tag that says, “don’t think”.
These experiences are colossal to my natural growth.
There is a universal calendar of warmth, 
Sunsets on beaches, 
and the leaves changing in forests up north.
Time is a way that we measure ourselves 
and relationships and work.
These powers that be in place today 
are trying to make sure we don’t blink.
Sold our souls in mouse-click agreements 
and the cost is every second.
The new frontier, 
with it’s invisible missions after our time. 
They are the colonizers of our mind.
Did not seem to even have to try.
Posting internet garbage that catches our eye.
My only choice sometimes feels like it’s 
to scream or cry.
Going for long walks in nature to try
and clear my mind. 
No attention to privacy, 
the cell phones ringing in our trembling hands.
They prey on my eyes 
and accompanying finger clicks.
Based on a model of wanting more. 
Searching for the words and stumbling.
Heavy-hearted hug-lost generation. 
Millions of millennials, 
through these walls we’ve built 
there is no residual vibration.
Drank too much coffee again 
and stayed up the last twelve days 
celebrating a perpetual fall 
Into and through web-like portals 
shown to me if my battery is charged long enough.
I can always hear the distant sounds of the engines, 
searching for anything and everything
so that I might escape my own thoughts 
and even our whole existence for just 
a few more seconds.
