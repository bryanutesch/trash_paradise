In A Distant Place

You feel 
a separation while in the forest. 
Traveling while standing still.
A blue brain moving thoughts like jig-saw pieces,   
surrounded by ghosts of mice. 
Ambivalently separated,   
with chewed corners, and long johns. 
Standing on this mountain,   
above a mile of dinosaur bones, 
I feel the separation too. 
There is a growing distance in crowded spaces.
Anxious shouting and laughter decay 
into my spiraling thoughts, 
and the faint sucking sounds from the leeches.
When long periods of time pass alone with the forest,
the forest stays with you. 
Formalities are left behind for nature's song
and the dancing of leaves. 
Spiderâ€™s woven patterns distract flapping moths
and beetles with delicacy. 
I am separated by waves of grace and majesty.
Almighty hell and H. E. hockey sticks of hickory. 
These thoughts flicker in places of the sesame. 
Separate paths dancing in synecdoche. 
Nature and wonder caress me 
down 
trails. 
Shadows. 
Grooves and ripples.
