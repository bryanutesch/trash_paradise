Goodbye

Dropped my phone and it cracked to pieces,
the screen now a web of broken future scrolling.
Then I remembered that nothing really exists anyways 
and instantly felt better.
This year I’m learning to say goodbye.
No more cigarettes, 
booze, 
mindless sex, 
and most importantly
to my self-harming instincts 
which I now have laid to rest.
To act not against yourself, 
but in harmony with the rhythm in your chest.
I feel like the fruit these days from mega super stores,
Never ripening, 
then all too often rotting away to our dismay.
It has all become too eager to be picked off the vine.
We need to let it grow.
Insides seem twisted and turned to new directions.
Packed like a van of acrobats 
trying not to go splat 
as they walk the line of desire 
between a wire from me to you.
Smacked with the thought of more romantic shit 
to turn me blue.
Mind killer clapping erasers till 
the dusty air chases out sight.
Braveness in brevity is choosy, 
and to resist myself daily would feed the fire of change.
Gotta listen to the winds of change go whistling by, 
and me, I’m gonna try.
Maybe one morning while cracking my eggs I won’t cry.
My heart’s so broken, 
I think you need an alibi.
When you left I lost my mind.
Orbiting the ways 
we used to play 
in that spaceship,
or biting on my fingers 
trying to rip the nails to perfection.
Writing about it is supposed to help 
or to distract and soothe the nerves.
Maybe I’m just trapped in ideologies 
and it’s all getting confused as my memories do.
Remove the art from bridges and streets because 
the overwhelming gray concrete soothes Sunday joggers.
Bury it all and throw the last piece 
of earth into the hole.
It’s hard when you have to admit 
to yourself that a dream has died.
Death is romance.
I’m helpless to the solstice 
that punctuates my life.
Free to be.
On fire, but feeling cold in the feet.
Spiraling into a center point.
Stability while empty.
Caring enough to remember.
Holding the threads in twisted 
overlord-like angled fingers.
Every twitch rips through to a subconscious oath.
Love lingers across these fibers on and on, 
even after life.
The biggest obstacle is my mind.
I must resist myself, to be free.
Half my childhood spent afraid of long stretching shadows.
My allowance of a good life can only start 
when I exit the dark cave 
where souls can sometimes drift.
Swerve away from the edge of the ditch.
I cut corners my whole life 
now I’m spitting out pieces of the puzzle.
Reordering my mind.
Rewinding patience with myself.
Doesn’t matter about the wealth.
Psycho romantic feeling a lot of unrest, 
without an address.
Couldn’t sleep.
Stayed awake all night cracking open 
these dusty ribs and pressing them 
against windows by morning 
letting the sunshine in.
I saw my particles join the dead.
The romance of goodbye.
The ways that we remember.
How good it feels to cry.
