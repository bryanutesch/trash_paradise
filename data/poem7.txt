For Mor

Your eyes are my eyes, 
they end each sentence watery. 
Our glasses are both empty, 
each breath returns a memory. 

Nature is my godhead, 
hugs me on long walks. 
Each leaf passed down 
came from creation. 
 
Taught me about spirituality 
hanging bird feeders 
and collecting nests on shelves. 
We share one thing in common, 
our minds never rest seeing 
as if through a darkened glass. 
 
You say once at a crossroads 
the wind spoke, 
but you could not hear its message. 
Standing on a bridge the waters moved you, 
but you did not know why. 
Distance between the hearts of beasts 
and the tides of meaning. 
They pull on me now 
as they pulled on you then. 
 
Your mind is my mind, 
it never stops its questioning. 
Our eyes have not seen, 
our ears have not heard, 
the many mysteries held inside grapes. 
As the legs run down the glass, 
we sit and stare through life's mirror, 
darkly. 
 
We hug and our hearts feel closer than the mystery 
of what miracle is sorcery. 
Those that seek will find 
the greatest of all things in life, 
is love.
