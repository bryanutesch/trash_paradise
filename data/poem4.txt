Agent Smith

On thinking of a fence built halfway
only to be torn down piece by piece 
and used for firewood.   
To cook slices of bologna and hot-dogs 
under smoky bridges 
where spoons bent to bullets 
laid out onto steel tracks 
still ringing down passageways     
and splitting through tunnels 
out over endless cornfields.     
Your eyes turned colors, 
but you still felt real   
until training and enlistment commenced.
Hidden behind the fallen past, 
stained with that lacquered fence 
the umbilical blood of detention 
and that bastard child.   
Every beer can was crushed 
when you came back   
from the middle of that smoldering 
campaign in the east.  
Looking for those weapons 
of mass destruction   
underneath a broken table 
holding a 30-rack of Budweiser.   
They made you pull the trigger 
for peace 
across the oil slick promised lands,   
but left you alone 
to wipe the blood off your rifle.   
Now we argue about their innocence 
and military coups in a stifle.
You made your eyes turn red 
a long time ago 
and your exhaled breath 
burns like cheap whiskey   
as the words “queer towel head” 
leave your mouth, 
grasping for a handle to hold onto.   
The sound you make 
screams around corners 
unfamiliar.
Kicking down dusty doors, 
passing glances on crowded Baghdad streets. 
Secret campaigns you hold onto 
like a pride filled sponge,
expected to be squeezed 
for a lifetime 
as tears hit a cold garage floor   
in between tire rotations somewhere 
far away from me now.     
I want to give comforting for the 
tongue-biting jaw-clenching spasms. 
Awareness for those post-traumatic 
inebriating moments, 
when desert sand fills your helmet     
and the boots start sinking, 
you down another fifth to focus 
on retirement prospects after serving. 
Exclaiming our country is greedy and unthankful.   
How many lives have dropped before?   
How many are left standing, 
serving the grateful?   
How many went launching through the air 
from hidden roadside IED's?   
Shrapnel wounded teenagers 
discuss death on plane trips home,
and dreaming of life outside the armed forces.   
“A pawn in the game” leaves my mouth 
and destroys my friendships 
like a desert storm.    
I make new acquaintances with broken down 
vets chained to never-ending ant lines,
encircling local veteran’s hospital buildings 
that trace an outline 
of where I spoke too soon.   
These heroes are more well-equipped to destroy 
than to be kept from starvation 
and not becoming destroyed themselves.  
Picking out the bone marrow, 
filling each with lead to fight the fight     
and come back home like ticking dynamite.   
Who came home to many lies 
and spitting out hate 
for a country who hates   
bloody wars that you were a part of 
since graduation.   
Negating the entire situation 
and even the doomsday clock,   
so that you can sleep at night 
while clutching onto your Glock. 
Semi-automatic is what you are to me, 
as we both continue to breath out 
the exit holes of our hate speech spray. 
The fence no longer stands where 
it was once built on that day. 
When I pass by that spot where we used to play 
as children,
all I see 
is a wall.
